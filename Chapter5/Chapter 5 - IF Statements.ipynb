You’ll learn to write simple if statements, and you’ll learn how to create a more complex series of if statements to  identify when the exact conditions you want are present. You’ll then apply this concept to lists, so you’ll be able to write a for loop that handles most items in a list one way but handles certain items with specific values in a different way."
