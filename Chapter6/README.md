# Chapter 6 - Dictionaries
#### In this chapter you’ll learn how to use Python’s dictionaries, which allow you to connect pieces of related information. You’ll learn how to access the information once it’s in a dictionary and how to modify that information. Because dictionaries can store an almost limitless amount of information, I’ll show you how to loop through the data in a dictionary. Additionally, you’ll learn to nest dictionaries inside lists, lists inside dictionaries, and even dictionaries inside other dictionaries.
